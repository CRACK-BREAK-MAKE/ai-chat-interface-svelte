## Developing

Create `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:
LANGCHAIN_OLLAMA_MODEL=local-llm

Start Ollama Server if using local model:

```
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open


# or
pnpm run dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
